## On Process

<p class="epistemic-fact">The paintings are made with hand-ground pigments suspended in linseed oil and applied to raw linen.</p>

<p class="epistemic-inference">This method likely emerged from a desire to foreground material agency — letting the medium participate in meaning-making rather than merely serving representation.</p>

<p class="epistemic-speculation">Perhaps the large scale relates to installation thinking: the canvas as environment rather than window.</p>

<p class="epistemic-question">How does the viewer's body respond differently to a 3-meter surface versus a 30-centimeter one?</p>

## Temporal Layers

<p class="temporal-past">Early work (2015-2018) explored figuration through pareidolic emergence.</p>

<p class="temporal-present">Current practice centers on chromatic fields and material transparency.</p>

<p class="temporal-future">Upcoming: investigation of binder chemistry and surface tension dynamics.</p>

<p class="temporal-timeless">Throughout: attention to the conditional, dream-like nature of perception.</p>
