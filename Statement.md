Look with increased publicity comes a different feeling of personal boundaries. I'm a private person, that is, I am used to operating in private, to indulge in paranoia that avoids meeting with reality. Now things are different. There's no 'private'. I find myself, although a private — that is, reneging on taking public accountability for my claims and actions, —  I resort to the public utility — the Internet — GitHub — the Blockchain — to hold what is precious to me and cannon, will not be sullied by it being out in the open.

Thus, I start pushing things online. Shoveling piles of old *materiel* to keep it prudent, weaving threads out there, in the open, dancing light, energy, attention, obliviousness to them. I've accumulated some wear and stress and experience that I will turn into publicly accessible prose and code. It may come up to something. It may now. That is on me.
