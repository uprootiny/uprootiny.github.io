# Color Playground

*Hands-on tools for contemplative color exploration*

## Interactive Experiences

### Breathing Palette Generator
Synchronized color breathing meditation - inhale to expand warm colors, exhale to reveal cool undertones. Based on traditional pranayama color visualization techniques.

**Try it:** Place hand on heart, breathe naturally, watch colors respond to your rhythm.

### Seasonal Light Simulator
Experience how the same color palette appears under different natural lighting conditions throughout the year. Includes golden hour, blue hour, overcast, and seasonal angle variations.

**Controls:** 
- Location slider (Arctic to Equatorial)
- Season wheel (Solstices and Equinoxes)
- Time of day dial
- Weather condition selector

### Pigment Chemistry Lab
Virtual mixing laboratory with historically accurate pigment behaviors. Watch ultramarine interact with chrome yellow, experience the granulation of burnt umber, see how different binders affect color saturation.

**Features:**
- 200+ historical pigments with authentic properties
- Multiple binder options (oil, egg tempera, watercolor, acrylic)
- Aging simulation (how colors change over decades)
- Compatibility warnings for fugitive combinations

### Emotion Color Mapping
Moving meditation where you paint abstract emotions using gesture and color. Includes guided emotional awareness exercises from different contemplative traditions.

**Emotions Available:**
- Basic: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust
- Subtle: Contentment, Melancholy, Irritation, Unease, Wonder, Aversion
- Contemplative: Equanimity, Loving-kindness, Compassion, Sympathetic joy
- Complex: Nostalgia, Anticipation, Bewilderment, Awe

### Color Temperature Meditation
Interactive tool for developing sensitivity to warm/cool color relationships. Includes training exercises used by traditional icon painters and contemporary color theorists.

**Exercises:**
- **Thermal Sorting**: Arrange random colors by temperature
- **Seasonal Moods**: Match colors to seasonal emotional qualities
- **Light Source Training**: Identify warm vs. cool lighting in photo examples
- **Skin Tone Practice**: Understanding temperature in portraiture

### Synesthetic Sound Painting
Real-time audio-visual painting experience. Speak, sing, or play instruments while the canvas responds with corresponding colors and textures based on synesthetic research.

**Sound Mapping:**
- **Frequency to Hue**: Low tones = reds/browns, high tones = blues/violets
- **Volume to Saturation**: Loud = vibrant, quiet = muted
- **Timbre to Texture**: Smooth = flat color, rough = textured application
- **Rhythm to Brushstroke**: Fast = quick marks, slow = long strokes

## Advanced Tools

### Cultural Color Context Explorer
Discover how the same colors carry different meanings across cultures. Interactive map showing color symbolism, traditional uses, and sacred associations worldwide.

**Cultures Featured:**
- Traditional Chinese Five Element theory
- Indian chakra and Ayurvedic color systems
- Islamic geometric color principles
- European heraldic color codes
- Indigenous American color symbolism
- African textile color traditions

### Meditation Posture Color Feedback
Experimental tool that uses webcam to analyze your meditation posture and suggests color environments that might support different contemplative states.

**Posture Recognition:**
- Sitting meditation: Grounding earth tones
- Walking meditation: Dynamic complementary pairs
- Lying meditation: Soft, cool harmonies
- Standing meditation: Stable, warm foundations

### Paint Consistency Simulator
Understand how different paint consistencies behave. Virtual paint with realistic fluid dynamics for understanding flow, coverage, and mixing properties.

**Consistency Options:**
- Watercolor transparency levels
- Oil paint buttery to liquid variations
- Acrylic heavy body to fluid ratios
- Ink wash concentration gradients
- Tempera traditional to modern formulations

### Color Memory Training
Develop your ability to remember and reproduce colors accurately. Based on traditional apprenticeship methods and modern cognitive science.

**Training Modules:**
- **Color Matching**: Reproduce target colors from memory
- **Sequence Memory**: Remember color orders in complex compositions
- **Shift Detection**: Notice subtle changes in complex color relationships
- **Context Adaptation**: How surrounding colors affect perception

## Experimental Prototypes

### AI Painting Completion
Upload a partial painting and watch AI trained on contemplative art traditions attempt to complete it in various historical styles.

**Style Options:**
- Traditional icon painting approaches
- Rothko-inspired color field completion
- Chinese landscape painting principles
- Abstract expressionist gesture continuation

### Biometric Color Response
Connect heart rate monitor or breathing sensor to see how your physiological state influences color preferences and mixing decisions.

**Measurements:**
- Heart rate variability → color harmony preferences
- Breathing depth → saturation intensity choices
- Stress indicators → warm/cool temperature bias
- Relaxation states → complexity vs. simplicity preferences

### Virtual Reality Paint Mixing
VR environment for experiencing paint mixing at molecular level. Watch pigment particles interact, understand granulation and transparency through immersive scale.

### Time-Lapse Painting Predictor
AI attempts to predict the next brushstroke in a painting sequence based on color theory, compositional principles, and artist behavior patterns.

## Technical Requirements

Most tools require:
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Microphone access (for sound-responsive tools)
- Camera access (for posture and biometric tools)
- Optional: Heart rate monitor via Bluetooth
- Recommended: Large, color-accurate display

**Accessibility:** All tools include colorblind-friendly alternatives and screen reader compatibility where possible.

*Remember: These are contemplative tools, not games. Approach with patience, curiosity, and respect for the deeper wisdom that color can teach.*
