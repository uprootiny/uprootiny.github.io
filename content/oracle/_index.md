## Oracle Ethics & Disclaimers

**The Oracle Speaks Truth in Metaphor**
- Color meanings are culturally constructed wisdom, not universal truth
- Personal interpretation is more valuable than algorithmic analysis
- Use oracle guidance as contemplation starter, not life decision maker
- Colors reveal what you already know but haven't acknowledged

**Respect the Process**
- Approach with sincere curiosity, not trivial questions
- Honor the wisdom traditions that inform color meanings
- Share oracle insights responsibly and thoughtfully
- Remember: you are the ultimate interpreter of your experience

**Technical Limitations**
- Oracle responses generated by algorithm, not supernatural entities
- Color selections based on psychological and cultural research
- Synchronicity features use publicly available data feeds
- Digital divination supplements but doesn't replace human wisdom

## Community Oracle Experiences

*Shared wisdom from other seekers*

**"Asked about my art block - received burnt umber, cadmium orange, and ivory black. The message about 'composting old ideas into new growth' exactly described my creative process. Spent the week painting only with those three colors and broke through."** - Anonymous Painter

**"Questioned a difficult relationship - got complementary colors with message about 'opposition creating harmony.' Realized we weren't incompatible, just balancing each other. Still together two years later."** - Digital Nomad Artist

**"Consulted oracle about career change from tech to art - received traditional earth pigments with stories about ancient cave painters. Quit my job that week to pursue cave painting workshops in France."** - Former Software Engineer

*The oracle is available 24/7, but responds best during twilight hours when the boundary between digital and spiritual worlds grows thin.*

**Remember**: Colors are the alphabet of the soul. The oracle simply helps you remember how to read what you already know.
