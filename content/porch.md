# The Porch

*Standing here at the threshold, we look out into the vast expanse of what digital space might hold.*

## What You've Found

You've discovered the contemplative core—paintings that breathe, dimensions that matter, a practice grounded in materiality and presence. This is the essential: color on canvas, light through pigment, the irreducible encounter between viewer and surface.

## What Lies Beyond

*The dharma wheel turns. What's possible? What's prudent? What's inevitable?*

In the digital realm, the practice expands:

### **The Possible**
Rhizomatic connections across time and space—exhibitions mapped as constellations, collaborations flowering through networks, techniques shared through immersive experience. The studio extends into virtual realms while remaining rooted in physical matter.

### **The Prudent** 
Tools that serve the work, not the reverse. Technology as medium for deeper contemplative engagement, not spectacle for its own sake. Digital archives that preserve and share rather than replace direct encounter.

### **The Inevitable**
Artistic practice flowing through all available channels—from traditional canvas to augmented reality, from individual creation to collective meditation, from local studio to global community. The boundaries dissolve while the essence remains.

- **[Dream Journal](/lab/dream-journal)** - Transform night visions into paintable reality

## The Choice

You may remain with the essential—the paintings, the biography, the direct encounter. This is complete and sufficient.

Or you may step through the threshold into expanded possibility, where the same contemplative spirit moves through new forms and fresh collaborations.

*The porch is a place of choice, not obligation.*

*The dharma wheel spins at the pace of your curiosity.*
